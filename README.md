## 1. Project Overview
**Retail Performance & Profitability Intelligence** is a high-impact Power BI solution designed to transform raw transactional data into actionable executive insights. This dashboard provides a 360-degree view of retail operations, focusing on revenue streams, profit margins, and inventory distribution across the Indian market.

## 2. Purpose & Business Problem
In the competitive retail landscape, stakeholders often struggle to identify "profit leaks" and high-performing segments within vast datasets. This project was built to:
* **Identify underperforming regions** and months with negative margins.
* **Analyze customer purchasing behavior** to optimize marketing efforts.
* **Monitor inventory movement** to prevent overstocking or stockouts in key categories.

## 3. Tech Stack
* **📊 Power BI Desktop** – Main platform for data visualization and report orchestration.
* **📂 Power Query (M)** – Used for intensive ETL processes, including data cleaning and column normalization of the **Orders** and **Details** datasets.
* **🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Engineered complex measures for dynamic KPIs, monthly variance analysis, and profit-to-sales ratios.
* **📝 Data Modeling** – Implemented a **Star Schema** with a 1:N relationship between the Orders and Details tables to ensure optimized report performance.

## 4. Data Source
The analysis is based on a multi-table retail dataset containing:
* **Orders:** Transactional records including Order IDs, Dates, Customers, and Geographical data for states like **Madhya Pradesh** and **Maharashtra**.
* **Details:** Granular line-item data including **₹ Amount**, **₹ Profit**, Quantity, and Product Categories.

## 5. Features & Business Insights

### 🛡️ Strategic Business Problem
A retail business generating **₹438K in revenue** needs to understand why certain months (like May and August) show significant profit dips despite stable sales volume.

### 🎯 Dashboard Goals
* **Revenue Tracking:** Monitor the **₹438K total revenue** and **₹37K net profit** in real-time.
* **Geospatial Analysis:** Identify top revenue drivers across **Indian States**.
* **Category Optimization:** Analyze why **Clothing** dominates volume (**63%**) while **Printers** drive the highest sub-category profit.

### 🔍 Walkthrough of Key Visuals
* **Executive KPI Header:** Displays Total Revenue (**₹438K**), Net Profit (**₹37K**), Avg. Transaction Value (**₹121.01**), and Total Units Sold (**5,615**).
* **Monthly Profitability Trend:** Highlights seasonal volatility, specifically identifying the recovery period in November (**₹10K+ Profit**).
* **Category Volume (Donut Chart):** Breaks down sales by Clothing (63%), Electronics (21%), and Furniture (17%).
* **Sub-Category Margin Analysis:** Reveals that **Printers** and **Bookcases** are the most lucrative segments.

### 📈 Business Impact
* **Loss Mitigation:** Identified loss-making months to allow management to investigate seasonal supply chain costs.
* **Regional Strategy:** Data proves that focus should remain on high-performing regions for expansion.
* **Inventory Efficiency:** Highlights low-profit sub-categories (like Tables) suggesting a need for price restructuring.
